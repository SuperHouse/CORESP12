CoreSP12 ESP8266 Board
======================
Copyright 2015 SuperHouse Automation Pty Ltd <http://www.superhouse.tv>  

An ESP8266 module with the same footprint as a Spark Core or Particle
Photon, so that it can be a drop-in replacement for some projects.

Note: only a subset of the Core's I/O pins are connected, so this will
only work for projects that specifically use those pins. There are
many other limitations so use at your own risk!
